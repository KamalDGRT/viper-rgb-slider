# viper-rgb-slider

Source Code of the App I coded after/while watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE6s8Zw3Gv8) video.

I built the app in iOS 15.

What that means is, in the video, he changes stuff in `AppDelegate.Swift`,
but I changed stuff in `SceneDelegate.Swift`.

#### Reason

From iOS 13, if your application has scenes, then AppDelegate is no longer
responsible for handling this and is moved to SceneDelegate.
